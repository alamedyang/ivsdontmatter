		IVs don't matter!
	</h4>
	<p>
		In Pok&eacute;mon Go, IVs don't matter. Here's why.
	</p>
	<h4>
		Well, okay... IVs matter sometimes.
	</h4>
	<p>
		But of all the things that matter, they matter the least.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Level matters more.</li>
		<li>Species (base stats) matters more.</li>
		<li>Shadow boost matters more.</li>
		<li>Moveset matters more.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>
		An interactive demonstration.
	</h4>
	<p>
		PoGo tells you almost nothing about your Pok&eacute;mon's stats,
		apart from its IVs (and CP), which on their own can be incredibly
		misleading.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's my hope that these interactive web toys will
		demonstrate what is actually happening in-game, including
		the exact role IVs play in a Pok&eacute;mon's performance.
	</p>
	<h4>
		A work in progress.
	</h4>
	<p>
		I am learning Vue.js to do this, and I work on it once in a while
		in my free time. While I have grand ambitions, progress will likely
		be piecemeal.
	</p>
